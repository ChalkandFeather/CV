## Marie Taylor

Nothing worthwhile happens by accident. I’m guided by unconventional choices, being both motivated and driven by a desire to stand out and be part of something meaningful. I have navigated my professional and personal life to achieve success and joy. From my early career as a professional Sound Engineer at Channel4 to becoming a specialist BBC sound technician. I demonstrated fastidious attention to detail in high stakes broadcast environments whilst maintaining seamless, high quality output for the viewing public.
Parenthood rightly recalculated my worklife balance, so I adapted to that situation and trained as a bespoke tailor in my free time, establishing a successful Tailoring business that produced costumes for clients inc. Royal Opera House and Madame Tussauds.
I would say with confidence, that colleagues, clients and friends would characterise me as reliable, determined and a good communicator. I am adaptable to situations and concious of ensuring the ease of others. I celebrate being a positive and collaborative, team member who is prepared to step-up and get involved, taking the lead when called upon and striking the right balance. I enjoy running, meditating, learning, music, reading and time with family and friends.
I stand by the claim that I created my opportunities and continue to work hard to achieve my goals, most recently earning a scholorship to Makers Academy Bootcamp. My transition into tech is a natural interweaving of existing engineering, precision craft and determined spirit which embraces my passion to embark on a new challenge.

## Work Experience

**Company Name** (start-date to end-date)  
_Your job title_

- Any experience, including roles and responsibilities and results achived in bullet point format.

**Company Name** (start-date to end-date)  
_Your job title_

- Any experience relevent to software development

## Skills

Your previous experience is really important. You will need to make it really clear to someone who has not worked in your field before exactly how your experience will be useful in software development.

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider projects you've worked on before Makers that you feel proud of and/or you think are relevent to technology. Good examples clearly explain the impact you've had.

Here's an example

#### Communication

<!-- example
I honed my communication skills while completing my thesis at university, which involved writing and defending a dissertation to a board of professors and Ph.D. candidates. I further developed these skills when I was working in a digital marketing agency where I presented quarterly business reviews to C-level stakeholders. In doing so, I synthesised complex technical information into a digestible but comprehensive story for the different levels of knowledge in the room. My communication skills have also often come in handy while training to be a developer. For example, I recently ran a session for my mentees, who have only been coding for a few weeks, on how to use mocks to improve unit test isolation. I received feedback that the session was well run and helped them understand this potentially confusing topic. -->

#### Another skill

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

#### Another skill

## Education

#### Makers Academy (start_date to end_date)

- Use short descriptions of what you did and a skill you used. (Similar to format from the 'Work Experience' section above)
- e.g Frequently used paring in order to problemsolve effeciently, requiring teamwork and communication.
- you might also mention aspects some other skills/knowledge listed below:
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine

#### Your University / College (start_date to end_date)

- Subject, any specialisms
- Grade
- Other cool stuff

#### Any other qualifications

That in some arguable way make you a better software developer or well-rounded person

## Hobbies

Any cool stuff that makes you a super part of a software development team
