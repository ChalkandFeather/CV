## Marie Taylor

Guided by unconventional choices, I am motivated and driven by the desire to create something meaningful, and have navigated my professional and personal life to achieve success and joy. From my early career as an engineer at Channel4 progressing to a sound technician at the BBC, I demonstrated fastidious attention to detail in high stakes, high pressured broadcast environments to maintain seamless, high quality output for UK audiences.
I celebrate being a positive and collaborative, team member who is prepared to step-up and get involved, taking the lead when called upon by striking the right balance.

With a keen interest in sustainability, I trained as a bespoke tailor in my free time, later going on to establish a successful Tailoring business that produced costumes for clients inc. Royal Opera House and Madame Tussauds. My tailoring studio was an ideal solution whilst caring for young children, but my long term aspirations required a greater leap…..Enter, Makers Academy. Following months of ‘skilling-up’ I achieved a scholarship place at Makers. I dedicated the next 4 months exclusively, to revolutionise my career on this intense ‘Oxbridge’, of Software Bootcamps. Laser focused on learning and humbly acknowledging the enormity of success, I proudly graduated with technical skills, portfolio, knowledge and the key to unlocking future learning and growth. This transition into tech certainly benefits from my acquired work and training experience, but the additional grounding I believe I offer rests in how I interact with colleagues and clients, with energy, professionalism and good nature.
My routine 'levellers' include running, meditating, learning, music, reading and time with family and friends.

## Work Experience

**Chalk and Feather Tailors** (09/2017 to 04/2022)  
_Tailor_

- Any experience, including roles and responsibilities and results achived in bullet point format.

**Company Name** (start-date to end-date)  
_Your job title_

- Any experience relevent to software development

## Skills

Your previous experience is really important. You will need to make it really clear to someone who has not worked in your field before exactly how your experience will be useful in software development.

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider projects you've worked on before Makers that you feel proud of and/or you think are relevent to technology. Good examples clearly explain the impact you've had.

Here's an example

#### Communication

<!-- example
I honed my communication skills while completing my thesis at university, which involved writing and defending a dissertation to a board of professors and Ph.D. candidates. I further developed these skills when I was working in a digital marketing agency where I presented quarterly business reviews to C-level stakeholders. In doing so, I synthesised complex technical information into a digestible but comprehensive story for the different levels of knowledge in the room. My communication skills have also often come in handy while training to be a developer. For example, I recently ran a session for my mentees, who have only been coding for a few weeks, on how to use mocks to improve unit test isolation. I received feedback that the session was well run and helped them understand this potentially confusing topic. -->

#### Another skill

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

#### Another skill

## Education

#### Makers Academy (start_date to end_date)

- Use short descriptions of what you did and a skill you used. (Similar to format from the 'Work Experience' section above)
- e.g Frequently used paring in order to problemsolve effeciently, requiring teamwork and communication.
- you might also mention aspects some other skills/knowledge listed below:
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP

#### Your University / College (start_date to end_date)

- Subject, any specialisms
- Grade
