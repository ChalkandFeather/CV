## Marie Taylor

Guided by unconventional choices, I am motivated and driven by the desire to create something meaningful, navigating my professional and personal life for success and joy. From my early career as an engineer at Channel4 progressing as a BBC Technician, I demonstrated fastidious attention to detail in high stakes broadcast environments to maintain seamless, high quality output for UK audiences.
I celebrate being a positive and collaborative team member. Prepared to step-up, get involved and take the lead, striking the right balance.
Keenly interested in sustainability, I trained as a bespoke tailor and established a successful Tailoring business with a client roll call inc. Royal Opera House, Madame Tussauds, Disney. My tailoring studio bridged the gap while caring for a young family, but longer term aspirations required a greater leap… Enter, Makers Academy. Following months of ‘skilling-up’ I gained a Makers scholarship. I dedicated the next 4 months exclusively, to revolutionize my career on this intense ‘Oxbridge’, of Software Bootcamps.
Having harnessed the underlying fundamentals to become a software developer, I graduated with an impressive collection of technical skills and the mindset of a successful engineer. Maybe even more importantly, I have discovered the key to unlock learning and knowledge growth for a progressive future. Staying humble, and staying curious.
Carefully curated choices have guided this transition into tech. Drawing on my technical broadcast background and creative, refined Tailoring skills. Always seeking quality. Always collaborative
Work is more than punching cards. I bring energy, professionalism and good nature into a team.
I care about a good many topics with sustainability and ethics playing a key role in learning and life choices. Music, podcasts, art and reading influences much of my free time, whilst running and meditation keep me on an even keel.
