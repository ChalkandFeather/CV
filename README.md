## Marie Taylor

Guided by unconventional choices, I am motivated and driven by the desire to create something meaningful, and have navigated my professional and personal life to achieve success and joy. From my early career as an engineer at Channel4 progressing to a sound technician at the BBC, I demonstrated fastidious attention to detail in high stakes, high pressured broadcast environments to maintain seamless, high quality output for UK audiences.
I celebrate being a positive and collaborative, team member who is prepared to step-up and get involved, taking the lead when called upon by striking the right balance.

With a keen interest in sustainability, I trained as a bespoke tailor in my free time, later going on to establish a successful Tailoring business that produced costumes for clients inc. Royal Opera House and Madame Tussauds. My tailoring studio was an ideal solution whilst caring for young children, but my long term aspirations required a greater leap. . .Enter, Makers Academy. Following months of ‘skilling-up’ I achieved a scholarship place at Makers. I dedicated the next 4 months exclusively, to revolutionise my career on this intense ‘Oxbridge’, of Software Bootcamps. Laser focused on learning and humbly acknowledging the enormity of success, I proudly graduated with technical skills, portfolio, knowledge and the key to unlocking future learning and growth. This transition into tech certainly benefits from my acquired work and training experience, but the additional grounding I believe I offer rests in how I interact with colleagues and clients, with energy, professionalism and good nature.
Inseperable from my very being are the 'levellers' which keep me grounded. If it wasn't for the time I dedicate to running, meditating, growing my brain,listening to music and podcasts, reading and spending time with family and friends, I simply wouldn't be who am I.

I also provided content for a number of broadcast items.
