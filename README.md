## About Me

I am motivated and driven by a desire to contribute to something meaningful, navigating my professional and personal life for success and joy. From my early career as an engineer at Channel4 progressing to a BBC Sound Technician, I have demonstrated fastidious attention to detail in high stakes broadcast environments to maintain seamless, high quality output for UK audiences.
I celebrate being a positive and collaborative team member. Prepared to step-up, get involved or take the lead to produce positive outcomes for stakeholders and colleagues alike. I have a proven track record in various media environments and as a business owner.
As a sustainability-driven entrepreneur, I pursued my passion for tailoring by acquiring bespoke training and establishing a thriving business with a prestigious role call including the Royal Opera House and Disney.
My tailoring studio bridged the gap whilst caring for a young family, but I had aspirations to return to a technology profession to pursue a career in software. I was awarded a scholarship at Makers Academy after months of self-directed learning.
Having harnessed the underlying concepts and fundamentals of a software developer, I graduated with an impressive collection of technical skills and the mindset of a successful engineer who thrives to solve complex real world problems through learning and knowledge growth, while staying humble and curious.
I am ambitious, and bring energy, professionalism and good nature into a team.

## Hobbies

Iâ€™m an avid reader of fiction and a music lover of too many genres to mention. Always hungry to learn, I enjoy long podcast discussions about philosophy, tech, health and society, attempting to stay informed on a range of topics. I try to spend quality-time with family and friends at home or visiting galleries and museums. In an effort to maintain an even keel, I frequently run and meditate. I regularly explore areas of interest in the tech world for insight and fun.
